NordForsk is the host organisation for NeIC. The NordForsk Board has delegated responsibility for strategic decisions regarding computing and data-storage infrastructure and reaction to upcoming opportunities to the NeIC Board. The NeIC Board reports to the NordForsk Board and to the boards of the national eInfrastructure organisations on an annual basis.

NeIC is managed by an Executive Team chaired by the NeIC Director. In collaboration with national eInfrastructure providers and user-community representatives, NeIC engages IT experts to participate in projects and operational activities. Projects are developed in accordance with the directions set out in the Nordic eScience Action Plan 2.0 (2015).
